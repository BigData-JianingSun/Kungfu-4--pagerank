# Kungfu-4--pagerank

## Project Goal
The main goal of our project is implementing page rank algorithms on AWS cloud. We take advantage of the link structure of the Web to produce a global ‘essential’ ranking of every web page which is called PageRank. It is an important method to help users and search engines keep track of important information from the vast amount of the World Wide Web.
